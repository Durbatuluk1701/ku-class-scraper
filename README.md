# KU Class Scraper

I created this tool to help efficiently look through and archive KU class data.

I grew tired of having to launch multiple queries on [classes.ku.edu](https://classes.ku.edu)
so this tool collects information over multiple semesters and years

Future Features:

- Display tool
- Stable query interface
- Data insights (when was a certain class last offered, what's changed, etc.)

Feel free to contribute
